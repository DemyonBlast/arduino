# Arduino+Sensors with frontend

This is a  proof of concept of a Academic project,  on a Arduino device setup with several sensors that receive data from the environment around them and being displayed on a front created with PHP OOP and Javascript.

## Getting Started

This project had three parts, acquiring the data with the Arduino, storing in the database and reading it to the frontend. For testing purposes I have supplied an examplery database.
Setup a localhost, in this scenario I took the liberty of using xampp, since it included everything I needed for the project. Import the databaseExample.sql into the phpmyadmin from xampp, open up the index.php on any browser and everything should be setup.

### Prerequisites
```
XAMPP V3.2.2
```

--------(If using an actual arduino with sensors)-----

*Hardware:
```

Arduino ATMega 2560

Sensors (This project is adaptable to any sensors, just needs to be tweeked the tables in the database to add new types of sensors if they dont exist already)
```
*Software:

```
Python 3.6
```
